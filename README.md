## How to install unsupported packages
If the package you are trying to install is .mp (legacy and old, but installable with modern mpkg), then just change the extension to .mpack.

If the package you are trying to install conflicts with the OS architecture, then DO NOT INSTALL IT. Architecture limitation is there to protect your computer from installing wrong package, and the limiting feature is optional for developer, but when developer limited the certain architecture, then If you think the package supports different architecture but limited to install, contact to the developer.
